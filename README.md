This repository includes the code for the exercises I solved during my time in the international 42 Beirut piscine;
a challenging 4-week program that requires patience, determination, and critical thinking skills. 

42 Beirut has fundamentally changed my perspective about programming. It also allowed me to see my peers as opportunities to grow and provide and receive support, not my competition. 

The exercises are solved using C language.
